# react-employee-directory

## Description
React-employee-directory utilizes `React` to be able to view basic information about a company's employees.<br>
This application makes an `Axios` call to take randomly generated employee information and renders a row for each employee with information displayed under the corresponding column headers.<br>
Users can sort employees up or sort them down by clicking on any of the column headers: **Name**, **Phone**, **Email**, and **Age**. Users can also utilize a searchbar that dynamically filters through the employees as they type based on matching results in name, phone number, e-mail address, or age.

## Installation
First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).<br>
Next, in order to install the necessary dependencies, run `npm install` from the command line while inside the root directory.<br>
